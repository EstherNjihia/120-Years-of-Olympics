# 120-Years-of-Olympics
This project presents an analysis of 120 years of Olympics data using SQL and visualization with Tableau. The data used in this analysis is sourced from the Kaggle and includes information on athletes, teams, events, and medals.

# Data Preparation
The data was first cleaned using python and preprocessed using SQL. Data cleaning tasks included removing duplicates, dealing with missing values, and formatting data consistently. The preprocessed and cleaned data was then exported to Tableau for further analysis.

# Analysis
In this analysis, we used SQL queries and Tableau visualization to explore patterns and trends in the data. Some of the key findings from the analysis include:

* Gender distribution over the years.
* Most Successful athletes 
* Sports and events that tend to have the most medals awarded.
* Analysis of the relationship between the sport and event and the number of medals won.
* Analysis of the relationship between the city and season and the number of medals won.
* Analysis of patterns or trends in the number of medals won over time.

# Visualization
Tableau was used to create interactive visualizations that allow for easy exploration of the data. The visualizations include line charts, bar charts, stacked bar charts and more.

# Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the 120 years of Olympics data. It highlights patterns and trends in the data that can help us understand the factors that contribute to winning more medals. The data visualization created with Tableau enables easy exploration of the data, providing a powerful tool for further analysis.

# Additional Note
The data used in this analysis is based on publicly available information from Kaggle, and the analysis is done on a sample data and should not be used for any official or financial decision making. The SQL queries and visualization are for demonstration purposes only.
